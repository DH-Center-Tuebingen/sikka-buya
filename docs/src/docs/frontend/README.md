# Frontend

The frontend app is written in Vue2 as it allows for a nice modern, clean and modular approach to design reusable components to create complex web-application, which remain maintainable.

## Primary Sections

The application consists of three primary sections:

1. Editor
1. Catalog
1. Map-App

### Editor

The primary focus was to get the editor quickly up and running for the numismatists to create properties and coin types. The coin types that are created in the process are used as a basis for the catalog and the map-app.
